#  Game Server Status Checker
This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) project aiming to monitor game servers, currently it is hard coded to monitor game servers at [edman.se](https://edman.se), but in the future, I want to connect it to a databse with authentication, allowing you to monitor arbitrary servers.

To launch, edit the .env.sample and rename it or copy it to .env

Then launch the app using docker-compose up -d
